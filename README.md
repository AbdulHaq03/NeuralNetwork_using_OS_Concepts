Project Title: Multi-Core Neural Network Operating System

**Problem Statement:**
This project aims to design an operating system that leverages multi-core processors to accelerate neural network computations. Using separate processes and threads, it facilitates inter-process communication for efficient exchange of data like weights and biases. Each neural network layer is represented by a distinct process, with individual neurons as threads. During backpropagation, the system updates weights and biases based on calculated gradients, optimizing multi-core processing.

**Detailed Description:**
Neural networks simulate the brain's structure, consisting of interconnected layers of neurons processing inputs to produce outputs. Multi-core processors offer the potential to expedite neural network computations through parallel processing. The proposed operating system adopts a modular approach, assigning each neural network layer to a separate process to enhance encapsulation and modularity. Neurons within each layer operate as threads, ensuring fine-grained parallelism and efficient resource utilization.

Inter-process communication via pipes facilitates seamless data exchange, including weights and biases, between layers and neurons. During backpropagation, a pivotal phase in neural network training, error signals propagate backward through layers, leveraging multi-core processing to expedite computations.
